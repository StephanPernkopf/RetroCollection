#RetroCollection
##Synopsis

During a project in web-design and web-programming we make a collection of our favourite retro games in order to learn more about organizing code segments, developing in javascript and delving into APIs.

The key feature of this site is the usage of the Gamepad API, which allows us to implement all games with gamepad support. Moreover, a simplistic pause menu enables the user to switch between games comfortably.
